                                    Health portal users need an easy, secure, and quick way to record their medical information and have access to general physical and mental wellbeing features.

                                    The Olive Health Portal will be a cross-platform, inclusive health and wellbeing portal where users can input their health and medical records as well as view educational resources to help them develop better habits for their overall wellbeing for both mental and physical health.

                        <p><i>Alright, first and foremost, who are we up against, how are users using these apps, 
                        and how can we stand out in the crowd on the app stores?</i>

                        <h3> Market Research</h3>
                        <p> Before starting to design, I first had to conduct a competitive market analysis. Our competitors would be Apple Fitness, 
                            Apple Health, Rountinery, Fitbit, and myChart as they provide either the ability to input data and connect to a healthcare 
                            provider to keep medical records, and/or provide resources for health education. The risk is our app will get overshadowed 
                            by applications that come with devices, such as Apple Health, that are pre-installed and free, or by applications that come 
                            with their own external hardware integrations for better tracking of quantifiable metrics. However, most of the applications 
                            in the market only provide either mental health or physical health functionalities and there are very few applications that provide both,
                            ignoring the overall view of combining multiple factors that contribute to a person’s health.<br>
                            <br>
                            Therefore, we would be able to take up a large presence in the market.

                                In order to understand the needs of our users, I had to first meet with them and ask them what they would want and need out of a health tracking app. 
                                I conducted interviews with people from a wide range of medical backgrounds and with different physiological needs. After my interviews, I compiled each response, 
                                needs and wants, and what motivates them about the subject into two User Personas to represent our potential users

                                I took the time to sketch out how the users would go through the application 
                                in a user flow chart and what functionalities they would require to accomplish 
                                their goal.

                            <p>Now that I had the user research done, I began to create and iterate on the wireframes
                                of the designs. Throughout the development, I designed and iterated on the screens of 
                                Olive, going through multiple stages of fidelity using the feedback given to me by both 
                                potential users from testing and peers to refine each iteration until I had designs that 
                                were usable for their intended functionality.

                                Time to test out the designs on our potential users! To ensure a productive and focused
                                user testing session, I constructed a usability test script consisting of 3 tasks:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Register and make an appointment with your Family Doctor</li>
                                    <li>Create a habit schedule and blacklist apps</li>
                                    <li>Create and Entry in your Health Journal</li>
                                </ol>
                                That together creates about 9-12 questions and takes up about 15-20 minutes to finish altogether. 
                            </p>

                                After conducting the tests with my 5 participants, I complied their responses into an affinity map, dividing them into 4 sections:
                                <br>Errors, Negative Feedback, Positive Feedback, and Observations

                                All participants found the software fairly easy to use and intuitive which is a great sign!
                                I received a lot of great constructive criticism about each error and frustration as well which I noted for future iterations.

                                <br>For the color palette I chose light greens, pastels, and neutral colors. I wanted to invoke a sense of growth and positivity for the user to

                                As my first ever UX/UI project, I believe I did pretty well to make a functional and user-friendly 
                                design for this software. Throughout the process, I used my knowledge of Game Design and what I learned 
                                from CareerFoundry to create these designs.<br>
                                <br>I definitely learned quite a bit from inception to finalized designs, from both the process and my peers. 
                                For me the most challenging parts were the wireframes and the aesthetics, both I’ve never practiced until now 
                                and will continue to improve with projects to come. Personally, I believe there are a large number of areas of 
                                improvements that need to be made for Olive to be a useful and functional product. There are missing functionalities
                                everywhere such as the calendar for appointments, the button to favorite entries and articles, the article page itself, 
                                a majority of the healthcare functions, etc. The product needs a visual overhaul to be more appealing and softer in terms 
                                of feel of the UI to fit with the intended theme of Olive. Although not completely necessary, the entire application also 
                                needs an expert in healthcare or deeper research done to make sure the information and processes provided are in-line with 
                                actual medical facts so that it can truly help the user and be an assistant to bettering one’s health.
